#Heart Disease Prediction System using Logistic Regression
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Heart Disease Prediction System using Logistic Regression. The system is designed to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on certain input features.DatasetThe system uses a dataset containing various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other medical parameters to train the logistic regression model. The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in the repository.RequirementsTo run the system, you will need to have Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:•NumPy•Pandas•Scikit-learnYou can install these libraries using pip:pip install numpy pandas scikit-learnUsage1.Clone the repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git2.Navigate to the project directory:cd heart-disease-prediction3.Run the heart_disease_prediction.py script:python heart_disease_prediction.py4.Follow the prompts to input the required information for prediction.ResultsAfter running the script, you will see the predicted probability of the person having heart disease based on the input features provided.ContributionFeel free to contribute to this project by forking the repository and submitting a pull request with your changes.LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance. Thank you for using our Heart Disease Prediction System!
